These categories are used as the basis for computing the seasonal and working-day adjusted data. These adjusted data are then summed to the six end-use aggregates for publication. These data are provided to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, from the U.S. Census Bureau, for use in the Balance of Payments and the National Income and Product Accounts.\n\nThe seasonal adjustment procedure is based on a model that estimates the monthly movements as percentages above or below the general level of each end-use commodity series (unlike other methods that redistribute the actual series values over the calendar year). Imports of petroleum and petroleum products are adjusted for the length of the month. Because of the extremely variable movements of the data series for aircraft, users studying data trends may wish to analyze aircraft separately from other trade. \nPrice Change Adjustments are done using the Fisher chain-weighted methodology.  The deflators are primarily based upon the monthly price indexes published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using techniques developed for the National Income and Product Accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nAdvanced Technology Products (ATP) \nAbout 500 of some 22,000 commodity classification codes used in reporting U.S. merchandise trade are identified as \"advanced technology\" codes and they meet the following criteria: \n         \n         The code contains products whose technology is from a recognized high technology field (e.g.), biotechnology). \n         These products represent leading edge technology in that field. \n         Such products constitute a significant part of all items covered in the selected classification code.  \n         This product and commodity-based measure of advanced technology differs from broader NAICS  industry-based measures which include all goods produced by a particular industry group, regardless of the level of technology embodied in the goods.\n              ATP classifications are assigned by the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau. \nAES Applicant\n                        The USPPI or authorized agent who applies to the Census Bureau for authorization to report export information electronically to the AES, or through AESDirect or its related applications.\nAESDirect\n  \n    A free Internet application supported by the U.S. Census Bureau that allows USPPIs, their authorized agent, or the authorized agent of the FPPI to transmit EEI through the AES via the Internet at www.aesdirect.gov. \n    \nAES Downtime Filing Citation\n        A statement used in place of a proof of filing citation when the AES or AESDirect computer systems experience a major failure.  The citation must appear on the bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions, or other commercial loading  documents.  The downtime filing citation  is not to be used when the filer’s system is down or experiencing delays.   \nAfrica\nAll Schedule C  codes beginning with \"7\".\nAgricultural Commodities \nAgricultural commodities, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are derived from farming or the cultivating of the soil, producing crops, and raising livestock. For International Trade Data Products, agricultural commodities and non-agricultural commodities are denoted by usda=0 and usda=1, respectively.\n            Air Carrier Codes \n\n  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) developed and maintains 2-digit and 3-digit codes for air carriers.  The U.S. Census Bureau created a 4-digit air carrier code.  Automated Export System (AES) and Automated Broker Interface (ABI) participants must report either the 2-digit IATA or the 3-digit IATA code.  The AES and ABI systems will not accept the Census Bureau's codes. See a list of air carrier codes.\nAir Shipping Weight (SWT)\nRepresents the gross weight in kilograms of shipments made by air, including the weight of moisture content, wrappings, crates, boxes, and containers (other than cargo vans and similar substantial outer containers). In some instances, shipments between the United States and countries abroad enter or depart through Canada or Mexico. Such shipments are recorded under the method of transportation by which they enter or depart the United States regardless of the method of transportation between Canada or Mexico and the country of origin or destination.Air Value \nThe value of goods that enter or leave the country by air. In some instances, shipments between the United States and countries abroad enter or depart through Canada or Mexico. Such shipments are recorded under the method of transportation by which they enter or depart the United States regardless of the method of transportation  between Canada or Mexico and the country of origin or destination.Air Waybill\n        The shipping document used for the transportation of air freight, which includes conditions, limitations of liability, shipping instructions, description of commodity, and applicable transportation charges.  It is generally similar to a straight non-negotiable bill of lading and is used for similar purposes.Annotation\n        An explanatory note (e.g., proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend)  placed on the  bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions, or  other commercial loading documents.Asia Near East\n     For a list of member countries, see  Country GroupingsAsia - South\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country GroupingsAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country GroupingsAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country GroupingsAuthorized Agent\n    An individual or legal entity physically located in or otherwise under the jurisdiction of the United States that has obtained power of attorney or written authorization from a USPPI or FPPI to act on its behalf, and for purposes of this part, to complete and file the EEI.\n    Automated Broker Interface (ABI)\n    A CBP system through which an importer or licensed customs broker can electronically file entry and entry summary data on goods imported into the United States.\n    Automated Export System (AES)\n    The\n      system, including AESDirect, for \n      collecting  EEI  information (or any\n      successor document) from persons\n      exporting goods from the United States,\n      Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands;\n      between Puerto Rico and the United\n      States; and to the U.S. Virgin Islands\n      from the United States or Puerto Rico.\n    Automated Export System Trade Interface Requirements (AESTIR)\n    The document that describes  the technical and operational requirements of the AES.  The AESTIR presents record  formats and other reference information used in the AES.Automated Foreign Trade Zone Reporting Program (AFTZRP)\n    The electronic reporting program used to transmit statistical data on goods admitted into a FTZ directly to the Census Bureau.Balance \nThe difference between exports and imports. A positive balance is called a surplus. A negative balance is called a deficit.\nBalance of Payments (BOP) \n  Goods on a Census basis are adjusted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to goods on a BOP basis to bring the data in line with the concepts and definitions used to prepare the international and national accounts. Broadly, the adjustments include changes in ownership that occur without goods passing into or out of the customs territory of the United States. These adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of the Census basis data, to eliminate duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in the international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition. (See more at Guide to Foreign Trade Statistics.)Bill of Lading (BL)\n  A document that establishes the terms of a contract between a shipper and a transportation company under which freight is to be moved between specified points for a specified charge.  Usually prepared by the authorized agent on forms issued by the carrier, it serves as a document of title, a contract of carriage, and a receipt for goods.Bond\nAn instrument used by CBP as security to ensure the payment of duties, taxes and fees and/or compliance with certain requirements such as the submission of manifest information.Bonded Warehouse \nAn approved private warehouse used for the storage of goods until duties or taxes are paid and the goods are properly released by CBP.  Bonds must be posted by the warehouse proprietor and by the importer to indemnify the government if the goods are released improperly. Goods entering a bonded warehouse are included in General Imports but not Imports for Consumption. They are considered Imports for Consumption when they leave the bonded warehouse for domestic consumption.\nBooking\nA reservation made with a carrier for a shipment of goods on a specific voyage, flight, truck or train.Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)\nA bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce that produces economic accounts statistics that enable government and business decision-makers, researchers, and the American public to follow and understand the performance of the Nation's economy. The BEA provides Balance of Payments adjustments to the international trade in goods data and data on international trade in services.\nBureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\nThis bureau within the U.S. Department of Commerce is concerned with the advancement of U.S. national security, foreign policy, and economic interests.  The BIS is responsible for regulating the export of sensitive goods and technologies; enforcing export control, antiboycott, and public safety laws; cooperating with and assisting other countries on export control and strategic trade issues; and assisting U.S. industry to comply with international arms control agreements.Buyer\nThe principal in the export transaction that purchases the commodities for delivery to the ultimate consignee.  The buyer and ultimate consignee may be the same. CAFTA-DR (Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement)\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country GroupingsCalculated Duty \n    Estimates of calculated duty do not necessarily reflect amounts of duty paid and should, therefore, be used with caution. The inclusion in the figures of some U.S. products returned after processing and assembly abroad, for which a portion of the value is eligible for duty free consideration, may cause these duty figures to be somewhat overstated as a result. In cases where articles are dutiable at various or special rates, a dutiable value is shown but no duty is calculated. Thus, there is an understatement in the estimates of calculated duty to the extent that these situations exist. Canadian Estimate\nEffective with January 2001 statistics, the current month data for exports to Canada contain an estimate for late arrivals and corrections.  The following month, this estimate is replaced, in the press release tables only, with the actual value of late receipts and corrections.  This estimate improves the current month data for exports to Canada and treats late receipts for exports to Canada in a manner more consistent with the treatment of late receipts for exports to other countries. Canadian Data Exchange\n  The data for U.S. exports to Canada are derived from import  data compiled by Canada.Card Count \nThe number of individual export or import line items.\nCargo\nGoods being transported.Carnet\nAn international customs document that allows the carnet holder to import into the United States or export to foreign countries certain goods on a temporary basis without the payment of duties.Carrier\nAn individual or legal entity in the business of transporting passengers or goods.  Airlines, trucking companies, railroad companies, shipping lines, pipeline companies, and slot charterers are all examples of carriers. Category Code \nA 3-digit Textile Code used in the Textile Data Products.\nCentral American Common Market\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country Groupings Charges \nAlso referred to as Import Charges.  The import charges represent the aggregate cost of all freight, insurance, and other charges (excluding U.S. import duties) incurred in bringing the merchandise from alongside the carrier at the port of export in the country of exportation and placing it alongside the carrier at the first port of entry in the United States. In the case of overland shipments originating in Canada or Mexico, such costs include freight, insurance, and all other charges, costs and expenses incurred in bringing the merchandise from the point of origin (where the merchandise begins its journey to the United States) in Canada or Mexico to the first port of entry.\nCIF (Cost, Insurance, Freight) Import Value\n  Represents the landed value of the merchandise at the first port of arrival in the United States. It is computed by adding import charges to the Customs value and therefore excludes U.S. import duties.Civil Penalty\n  A monetary penalty imposed on a USPPI, authorized agent, FPPI, carrier, or other party to the transaction for violating the Foreign Trade Regulations, including failing to file export information, filing false or misleading information, filing information late, and/or using the AES to further any illegal activity, and/or violating any other regulations of this part.\nClassification \n A systematic grouping of commodities, such as the Harmonized System (HS), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTS), Schedule B, Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), or End-Use. The Foreign Trade Division collects statistical import data by HTS numbers and export data by Schedule B numbers. These are recoded to SITC, NAICS, and End-Use codes for publication in the monthly trade press release.  \nCommerce Control List (CCL)\nA list of items found in Supplement No. 1 to Part 774 of the EAR.  Supplement No. 2 to Part 774 of the EAR contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.\nCommercial Loading Document\nA document that establishes the terms of a contract between a shipper and a transportation company under which freight is to be moved between points for a specific charge. It is usually prepared by the shipper or the shipper's agent or the carrier and serves as a contract of carriage. Examples of commercial loading documents include the air waybill, ocean bill of lading, truck bill and rail bill of lading.\nCommodity \n An economic good such as a product of agriculture, mining, or a customized or mass produced article that is readily exchanged within the market. Compliance Alert\n  An electronic response sent to the filer by the AES when the shipment was not reported in accordance with this part (e.g., late filing).  The filer is required to review their filing practices and take steps to conform with export reporting requirements.\nConfidentiality \n Title 13 United States Code, Section 9, prohibits the Census Bureau from publishing results in which an individual's or business' data can be identified. \nConsignee\nThe person or entity named in a freight contract, a contract of carriage that designates to whom goods have been consigned, and that has the legal right to claim the goods at the destination.Consignment\nDelivery of goods from a USPPI (the consignor) to an agent (consignee) under agreement that the agent sells the goods for the account of the USPPI. Constant Dollar Adjustment\nThe U.S. Census Bureau began publishing seasonally adjusted constant dollar merchandise trade data in January 1990. The constant dollar series was created to meet the requirements of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Census replaced its fixed-weighted constant dollar series with a chained-dollar series with the release of the April 2003 issue of the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services (FT-900), on June 13, 2003. We adopted this methodology to improve the quality of the constant dollar series and for consistency with other official government statistics released by the Department of Commerce. Users are reminded, however, that the Census constant dollar series will not match BEA's constant dollar series because of the underlying coverage differences between the current dollar National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and Census data.  See Real Dollars.Consumption (Imports Only) \n   Measures the total of merchandise that has physically cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or entering after withdrawal for consumption from bonded warehouses under Customs custody or from Foreign Trade Zones. Many countries use the term \"special imports\" to designate statistics compiled on this basis. Container\nA uniform, reusable metal \"box\" in which goods are shipped by vessel, truck, or rail as defined in the International Convention for Safe Containers, as amended (TIAS 9037; 29 U.S.T. 3709).  Containerized Shipments\nShipments transported in any van-type container. Containerized import shipments are identified by the reported method of transportation code, and therefore all shipments are either identified as containerized or non-containerized. This excludes containerized import shipments into Foreign Trade Zones, which are not identified by CBP and as such are not included in this release. Export shipments are reported with an indicator that can either identify an export shipment as containerized or non-containerized. Filers may not always report an indicator, resulting in missing containerized information on export shipments. No attempt is made to estimate the value or shipping weight of containerized exports with missing indicators. Therefore, the containerized export data may be understated. Controlling Agency\n  The agency responsible for the license determination on specified goods exported from the United States.Cost of Goods Sold\n  Cost of goods sold is the sum of expenses incurred in the USPPI's acquisition or production of the goods.\nCountry Codes\n   The names and codes of the countries of the world are listed in Schedule C , Classification of Country and Territory Designations for U.S. Foreign Trade Statistics. \nCountry of Destination (Exports Only) \n   Country of destination for exports is the country where the goods are to be consumed, further processed, or manufactured, as known to the USPPI at the time of exportation.\nCountry of Origin (Imports Only) \n    The country where the goods were mined, grown, or manufactured or where each foreign material used or incorporated in a good underwent a change in tariff classification indicating a substantial transformation under the applicable rule of origin for the good.  The country of origin for U.S. imports are reported in terms of the International Standards Organization (ISO)  country codes designated in the Schedule C , Classification of Country and Territory Designations. Certain foreign trade reports show country subcodes to indicate special tariff treatment afforded some imported articles.Country of Shipment (Imports Only) \n   The country where the merchandise was shipped. The U.S. Census Bureau does not publish statistics based on the country of shipment.\nCountry of Ultimate Destination \n The country where the goods are to be consumed, further processed, stored, or\nmanufactured, as known to the USPPI at the time of export. (See §30.6(a)(5). \nCountry Subcodes\n  Indicators used to identify special trade agreements and are found in several U.S. Census imports of merchandise products.\nCriminal penalty\nFor the purpose of this part, a penalty imposed for knowingly or willfully violating the Foreign Trade Regulations, including failing to file export information, filing false or misleading information, filing information late, and/or using the AES to further illegal activity.  The criminal penalty includes fines, imprisonment, and/or forfeiture.\nCumulative to date or Year-to-Date (YTD)\nData for January of the current year through the current data month. For example, if merchandise trade data were just released for July, the cumulative to date totals would be for the first seven months (January-July).Customized Data Request (Special Request) \n Foreign Trade Data Service that allows customers to request customized report(s) to their specifications for a fee.\nCustoms Broker\n  An individual or entity licensed to enter and clear imported goods through CBP for another individual or entity.\n Customs Value \n   The Customs value is the value of imports as appraised by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the legal requirements of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. This value is generally defined as the price actually paid or payable for merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, excluding U.S. import duties, freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in bringing the merchandise to the United States. The term \"price actually paid or payable\" means the total payment (whether direct or indirect, and exclusive of any costs, charges, or expenses incurred for transportation, insurance, and related services incident to the international shipment of the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importation in the United States) made, or to be made, for imported merchandise by the buyer to, or for the benefit, of the seller. In the case of transactions between related parties, the relationship between buyer and seller should not influence the Customs value. In those instances where assistance was furnished to a foreign manufacturer for use in producing an article which is imported into the United States, the value of the assistance is required to be included in the value reported for the merchandise. Such \"assists\" include both tangible and intangible assistance, such as machinery, tools, dies and molds, blue prints, copyrights, research and development, and engineering and consulting services. If the value of these \"assists\" is identified and separately reported, it is subtracted from the value during statistical processing. However, where it is not possible to isolate the value of \"assists\", they are included. In these cases the unit values may be increased due to the inclusion of such \"assists\". Deficit \n When import value is greater than export value.Destination\nThe foreign location to which a shipment is consigned.Diplomatic Pouch\n  Any properly identified and  sealed pouch, package, envelope, bag, or other container that is used to  transport official correspondence, documents, and articles intended for  official use, between Embassies, legations, or consulates, and the foreign  office of any government.Disclosure Limitation \n\n  Disclosure limitation is the process for protecting the confidentiality of data. A disclosure of data occurs when published statistical information identifies either an individual or business that has provided information under a pledge of confidentiality. The techniques used by the Census Bureau to protect confidentiality in tabulations vary, depending on the type of data.\n   To limit disclosure, statistics for two or more CBP ports may be combined and published under an arbitrary designation, or shipping weight or value may be excluded from an individual CBP port. In addition, value and  shipping weight for a commodity may be placed in separate ports. Consequently, statistics for individual ports may be understated or overstated due to the suppression of the weight or value of the affected commodities. See Suppression below.Distributor\nAn agent who sells directly for a supplier and maintains an inventory of the supplier's products.\nDistrict and Port Classification \n   The names and codes of districts and ports are listed in Schedule D, Classification of U.S. Customs Districts and Ports for Foreign Trade Statistics. The geographical limits of each district are published in the U.S. Customs Regulations. Schedule D is published as a statistical annex in HTSA and as a part of Schedule B. Statistics for two or more Customs Districts may be combined and published under an arbitrary designation or shipping weight may be excluded from an individual Customs District as a solution to disclosure situations. Consequently, statistics for individual ports may be understated due to the suppression of the weight of the affected commodities.District (or Port) of Entry\n     The district (or port) in which merchandise clears Customs for entry into consumption channels, bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones. \nDistrict (or Port) of Exportation \n   For vessel or air shipments, the  district (or port) in which the merchandise is loaded on the vessel or aircraft which takes the merchandise out of the country. For rail, truck, pipeline, or other overland transportation, the  district (or port) through which the merchandise crosses the U.S. border into foreign territory. Aircraft exported under their own power are credited to the  district from which they are flown out of the United States.\nDistrict (or Port) of Unlading\n    The district where merchandise is unloaded from the importing vessel or aircraft.Districts (Special) \nThere are three special districts included for statistical purposes in special Customs districts and are not reported by geographical location of the individual Customs district of entry or exportation: (a) Vessels under their own power or afloat (imports and exports); (b) Low-valued imports and exports; (c) Mail shipments (exports only).\n Domestic Exports \n  Goods that are grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and commodities of foreign origin that have been changed in the United States, including changes made in a U.S. FTZ, from the form in which they were imported, or that have been enhanced in value or improved in condition by further processing or manufacturing in the United States.

Issuing agencies include, but are not limited to, the U.S. State Department; the BIS; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; and the Drug Enforcement Administration permit to export.Exports\n Exports measure the total physical movement of merchandise out of the United States to foreign countries whether such merchandise is exported from within the U.S. Customs territory or from a CBP bonded warehouse or a U.S. Foreign Trade Zone. Exports (Domestic) \nGoods that are grown, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and commodities of foreign origin that have been changed in the United States, including changes made in a U.S. Foreign Trade Zone, from the form in which they were imported, or that have been enhanced in value or improved in condition by further processing or manufacturing in the United States. For International Trade Data Products, domestic exports are denoted by df=1.Exports (Foreign) \nExports of foreign goods (re-exports) consist of commodities\n          of foreign origin that have previously been admitted to a U.S. Foreign Trade Zones or entered the United States for consumption,\n          including entry into a CBP bonded warehouse, and which,\n          at the time of exportation, are in substantially the same condition as\n          when imported. \nFor International Trade Data Products, foreign exports are denoted by df=2.Exports (Total) \nTotal exports are calculated by adding domestic exports to foreign exports (also called re-exports).

Export Value \n   The value of exports at the U.S. seaport, airport, or border port of export, based on the transaction price, including inland freight, insurance, and other charges incurred in placing the merchandise alongside the carrier at the U.S. port of exportation. The value, as defined, excludes the cost of loading the merchandise aboard the exporting carrier and also excludes freight, insurance, and any charges or transportation costs beyond the port of exportation. \nFreight\n A term for cargo or the cost of shipping.Freight Forwarder \n An independent business which handles export shipments for compensation.  General Imports\n  Measures the total physical arrivals of merchandise from foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels immediately or is entered into bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones  under CBP custody.\n Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) \n A framework under which certain developing countries are given preferential tariff treatment to their manufactured goods.Geographic Discrepancies \n   The following types of shipments are included for statistical purposes in special CBP port groupings and are not reported by their geographical location: Vessels under their own power or afloat (imports and exports); Low valued imports and exports; Mail shipments (exports only); Norfolk VA, Charleston SC, and Mobile AL (Exports of bituminous coal); Wilmington NC and Savannah GA (Exports of cotton linter pulp). Goods \nMerchandise, supplies, raw materials, and products or any other item identified by a Harmonized System (HS) code. \nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\n The market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, regardless of nationality; GDP replaced Gross National Product (GNP) as the primary measure of U.S. production in 1991. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)\nGross National Product (GNP)\nThe market value of goods and services produced by labor and property supplied by U.S. residents, regardless of where they are located. It was used as the primary measure of U.S. production prior to 1991, when it was replaced by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)\nHarmonized System (HS) \n\n  The Harmonized System (HS) is an international classification system administered by the World Customs Organization. The 2-, 4-, and 6-digit HS headings and subheadings are the basis for the 10-digit statistical classification systems used in the United States.  The HS is revised approximately every five years. For more information, see The World Customs Organization.\n        In the United States, the import classification system is called the \"Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSA)\" while the export system is called the \"Schedule B\".\n\n Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSA)\n   The import statistics are initially collected and compiled in terms of approximately 18,000 10-digit commodity codes in the HTSA. The HTSA is maintained by the U.S. International Trade Commission and is based on the 2-, 4-, and 6-digit headings and subheadings of the international Harmonized System (HS). The HTSA is revised and published at least twice annually; new codes are usually effective January 1 and July 1. Suggested changes to the statistical requirements of the HTSA should be submitted in the form of a request to the 484(f) Committee. For more information, see http://hts.usitc.gov/.\nHousehold Goods\nUsual and reasonable kinds and quantities of  personal property necessary and appropriate for use by the USPPI in the USPPI’s  dwelling in a foreign country that are shipped under a bill of lading or an air waybill and are not intended for sale.\nImports \n \n  All goods physically brought into the United States, including:    (1) Goods of foreign origin, and        (2) Goods of domestic origin returned to the United States without substantial transformation affecting a change in tariff classification under an applicable rule of origin. \n\nImport Adjustments \n See  AdjustmentsImport Charges\n The import charges represent the aggregate cost of all freight, insurance, and other charges (excluding U.S. import duties) incurred in bringing the merchandise from alongside the carrier at the port of exportation in the country of exportation and placing it alongside the carrier at the first port of entry in the United States. In the case of overland shipments originating in Canada or Mexico, such costs include freight, insurance, and all other charges, costs and expenses incurred in bringing the merchandise from the point of origin (where the merchandise begins its journey to the United States) in Canada or Mexico to the first port of entry.\nImports (General)\nMeasures the total physical arrivals of merchandise from foreign countries, whether such merchandise enters consumption channels immediately or is entered into  bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones  under CBP custody.Imports for Consumption\n  Measures the total of merchandise that has physically cleared through Customs either entering consumption channels immediately or entering after withdrawal for consumption from  bonded warehouses or Foreign Trade Zones  under CBP custody. Many countries use the term \"special imports\" to designate statistics compiled on this basis. \nInbond \n   A procedure administered by CBP under which goods are transported or warehoused under CBP supervision until the goods are either formally entered into the customs territory of the United States and duties are paid, or until they are exported from the United States.  The procedure is so named because the cargo moves under a bond (financial liability assured by the principal on the bond) from the gateway seaport, airport, or land border port and remains \"inbond\" until CBP releases the cargo at the inland Customs point or at the port of export. \nInland Freight\n  The cost to ship goods between points inland and the seaport, airport, or land border port of export, other than baggage, express mail, or regular mail.Inland Freight in Canada \n   An addition is made for inland freight in Canada.  Imports of goods from all countries are valued at the foreign port of export, including inland freight charges (\"customs value\").  In the case of Canada, this should be the cost of the goods at the U.S. border.  However, the customs value for imports for certain Canadian goods is the point of origin in Canada.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) makes an addition for the inland freight charges of transporting these Canadian goods to the U.S. border to make the value comparable to the customs value as reported by all other countries.  Insurance and freight charges for transporting goods to the United States from all other countries to the U.S. border are included in services by the BEA.  (The same procedure is used for Mexico as an Other Adjustment, but is much smaller.)\nIntermediate Consignee\n  The person or entity in the foreign country who acts as an agent for the principal party in interest with the purpose of effecting delivery of items to the ultimate consignee. The intermediate consignee may be a bank, forwarding agent, or other person who acts as an agent for a principal party in interest.Internal Transaction Number (ITN)\n  The AES generated number assigned to a shipment confirming that an EEI transaction was accepted and is on file in the AES.  The ITN must appear on the bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions, or  other commercial loading documents.\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) Country Codes\nThe 2-position alphabetic code for countries used to identify countries for which shipments are reportable. While U.S. international trade data are collected using the ISO code, they are published using the 4-digit Schedule C  Country Code.\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)\nRegulations administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) within the U.S. State Department that provide for the control of the export and temporary import of defense articles and defense services.  These regulations are located in  22 CFR 120-130.International Waters\nWaters located outside the U.S. territorial sea, which extends 12 nautical  miles measured from the baselines of the United States, and outside the territory  of any foreign country, including the territorial waters thereof.  Note that vessels, platforms, buoys, undersea  systems, and other similar structures that are located in international waters,  but are attached permanently or temporarily to a country’s continental shelf,  are considered to be within the territory of that country.Interplant Correspondence\nRecords or\n  documents from a U.S. firm to its\n  subsidiary or affiliate, whether in the\n  United States or overseas. In-Transit Shipments \n   Goods shipped through the United States, Puerto Rico, or the  U.S. Virgin Islands from one foreign country or area to another foreign country or area without entering the consumption channels of the United States.  In-transit shipments should not be part of the U.S. international trade data.\nIssued Banknotes\n  A promissory note intended to circulate as money, usually printed on paper or plastic, issued by a bank with a specific denomination, payable to an individual, entity or the bearer.Kg (Kilogram) \n   See Conversion Tables and Units of Quantity \nL (Liter) \n  See Conversion Tables and Units of QuantityLatin American Free Trade Market (LAFTA)\n    For a list of member countries, see  Country Groupings License Applicant\n   The person who applies for an export or re-export license.  (For example, obtaining a license for commodities, software, or technology that are listed on the CCL.)\nLicense Exception\n  An authorization that allows a USPPI or other appropriate party to export or re-export under stated conditions, items subject to the EAR that would otherwise require a license under the EAR.  The BIS License Exceptions are currently contained in Part 740 of the EAR (15 CFR 740).\nLow-Value Shipments \n   Shipments whose value is so low that trade is estimated instead of being based on trade filings. For exports, these are items where the value of trade is $2,500 or less for each individual Schedule B number. Low value estimates represent about 2.5 percent of the monthly value of U.S. exports. For imports, the threshold is $2,000 or less for most shipments although certain shipments' thresholds are $250. Low value shipments represent about 1 percent of the monthly import value.\nManifest\nA collection of documents, including forms, such as the cargo declaration and annotated bill of lading, that lists and describes the cargo contents of a carrier, container, or warehouse.  Carriers required to file manifests with the CBP Port Director must include an AES filing citation, exemption legend, or exclusion legend for all cargo being transported.  In general, the shipping manifest is a document in the public domain and can be viewed by anyone.  \nMass-Market Software\n  Software that is generally available to the public by being sold at retail selling points, or directly from the software developer or supplier, by means of over-the-counter transactions, mail-order transactions, telephone transactions, or electronic mail-order transactions, and designed for installation by the user without further substantial technical support by the developer or supplier.Merchandise\nGoods, supplies, raw materials, and products or any other item identified by a Harmonized System (HS) code. M (Meter) \n  See Conversion Tables and Units of QuantityMerchandise Trade \n   Goods, including physical items such as automobiles, steel, food, clothing, appliances, and furniture. Merchandise trade does not include services or balance of payment adjustments. \nMerchandise Trade Balance \n The merchandise trade balance represents the difference between U.S. total exports based on F.A.S. values and U.S. general imports based on Customs values. This balance corresponds to a measurement of the international payments or credit flows resulting from the physical movement of goods between the U.S. and foreign countries. Monthly balances are based on seasonally adjusted data.\nMethod of Transportation (MOT) \nThe method by which goods arrive in or are exported from the United States by way of seaports, airports, or land border crossing points. Methods of transportation include vessel, air, truck, rail, or other. For statistical purposes, methods of transportation are classified as vessel, air, or other.\nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) \n   An agreement between two or more government agencies detailing the release or exchange of confidential or prerelease data, the purpose for which the data may be used, who may  have access to the data, the restrictions on use of the data, and how the data will be protected from unauthorized disclosure.North American      Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\n      The formal agreement, or treaty, among Canada, Mexico, and the United States to promote trade amongst the three countries. It includes measures for the elimination of tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade, as well as numerous specific provisions concerning the conduct of trade and investment.

For a list of member countries, see  Country Groupings\n              North      American Industry Classification System (NAICS)\n                Replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system in 1997 as the industry classification system used by the statistical agencies of the United States. Under NAICS, economic units that use like processes to produce goods or services are grouped together, creating a \"production-oriented\" system. NAICS codes are assigned by the Economic Classification Policy Committee at the U.S. Census Bureau.

SITC code 33.\n      \n  Port of Export\n    \n      The port of export is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seaport or airport where the goods are loaded on the aircraft or vessel that is taking the goods out of the United States, or the CBP port where exports by overland transportation cross the U.S. border into Canada or Mexico.  For EEI reporting purposes only, for goods loaded aboard an aircraft or vessel that stops at several ports before clearing to the foreign country, the port of export is the first CBP port where the goods were loaded. For goods off-loaded from the original conveyance to another conveyance (even if the aircraft or vessel belongs to the same carrier) at any of the ports, the port where the goods were loaded on the last conveyance before going foreign is the port of export.  The port of export  is reported in terms of Schedule D, “Classification of CBP Districts and Ports.”  Use port code 8000 for shipments by mail.\n      \n  Postdeparture      Filing\n    \n      The privilege granted to approved USPPIs for their EEI to be filed up to five (5) calendar days after the date of export.  \n      \n  Postdeparture Filing Citation\n    \n      A notation placed on the bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions, or other commercial loading documents that states that the EEI will be filed after departure of the carrier.  \n      \n  Power of Attorney\n    \n      A legal authorization, in writing, from a USPPI or FPPI stating that an agent has authority to act as the principal party’s true and lawful agent for purposes of preparing and filing the EEI in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States.  \n      \n  Preferences\n    \n      Special trade advantages (e.g. tariff preferences) given to least developed countries by governments of developed countries in order to promote export growth and development. Special trade advantages include licensing practices, quotas or preferential application of other measures, including taxes in the non-tariff area. \n      \n  Primary Benefit\n    \n      Receiving the majority payment or exchange of item of value or other legal consideration resulting from an export trade transaction; usually monetary. \n      \n  Primary      Quantity\n    \n      The quantity is the total number of units that correspond to the first unit of measure specified in the Schedule B or HTSA.  Where the unit of measure is in terms of weight (grams, kilograms, metric tons, etc.), the quantity reflects the net weight, not including the weight of barrels, boxes, or other bulky coverings, and not including salt or pickle in the case of salted or pickled fish or meats.  For a few commodities where “content grams” or “content kilograms” or some similar weight unit is specified in Schedule B or HTSA, the quantity may be less than the net weight.  The quantity is reported as a whole unit only, without commas or decimals.  If the quantity contains a fraction of a whole unit, round fractions of one-half unit or more up and fractions of less than one-half unit down to the nearest whole unit.  (For example, where the unit for a given commodity is in terms of “tons,” a net quantity of 8.4 tons would be reported as 8 for the quantity.  If the quantity is less than one unit, the quantity is 1.) \n      \n  Primary Unit of Measure\n    \n      The unit of measure shall correspond to the primary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSA.  If neither Schedule B nor HTSA specifies a unit of measure for the item, an “X” is required in the unit of measure field \n      \n  Principal      Parties in Interest\n    \n      Those persons in a transaction that receive the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the transaction.  Generally, the principals in a transaction are the seller and the buyer.  In most cases, the forwarding or other agent is not a principal party in interest. \n      \n  Program Indicators\n    \n      Types of General System of Preferences or Trade Agreements. \n      \n  Proof of Filing Citation\n    \n      A notation placed on the bill of lading, air waybill, export shipping instructions, or other commercial loading document, usually for carrier use, that provides evidence that the EEI has been filed and accepted in the AES.\n        \n      \n    Quantity\n    \n      Units of quantity shown are published in terms of the units specified in the HTSA and Schedule B for each classification. When two units of quantity are required for an item in the HTSA or Schedule B, both units are shown along with the value. Quantity is only used at the 10-digit HS level. Any higher aggregation may result in multiple units of quantity being included.\n      \n    Quota\n        \n          Import quotas control the amount or volume of various commodities that can be imported into the United States during a specified period of time. Quotas are established by legislation, Presidential Proclamations or Executive Orders. Quotas are announced in specific legislation or may be provided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

Quality assurance procedures are performed at every stage of collection, processing and tabulation; however the data are still subject to several types of nonsampling errors. The most significant of these include reporting errors, undocumented shipments, timeliness, data capture errors, and errors in the estimation of low-valued transactions:\n      \n        Reporting       Errors: Reporting errors are mistakes or omissions made by importers,       exporters or their agents in their import or export declarations. Most       errors involve missing or invalid commodity classification codes and       missing or incorrect quantities or shipping weights. They have a       negligible effect on import, export and balance of trade statistics.       However, they can affect the detailed commodity statistics.\n        Undocumented       Shipments: Federal regulations require importers, exporters or their       agents to report all merchandise shipments above established exemption       levels. The U. S. Census Bureau has determined that not all required       documents are filed, particularly for exports.\n        Timeliness and       Data Capture Errors: The U.S. Census Bureau captures import and export       information from administrative documents and through various automated       collection programs. Documents may be lost, data may be incorrectly       keyed, coded or recorded. Transactions may be included in a subsequent       month's statistics if received late.\n        Low-Value Shipments: The total values of transactions valued as much as or below       $2,500 for exports and $2,000 ($250 for certain quota items) for imports       are estimated for each country, using factors based on the ratios of       low-valued shipments to individual country totals for past periods.\n        \n      The U. S. Census Bureau recommends that data users incorporate this information into their analyses, as nonsampling errors could impact the conclusion drawn from the results.

The Schedule B is maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau and is based on the 4- and 6-digit headings and subheadings of the international Harmonized System (HS). The Schedule B is revised once annually; new codes are usually effective January 1. Suggested changes to the statistical reporting requirements of the Schedule B should be submitted in the form of a request to the 484(f) Committee.\n                \n              Schedule C \n                \n                  The Classification of Country and Territory Designations.

The Census Bureau is seasonally adjusting the merchandise trade data at the most detailed end-use level possible. These detailed data are then summed to the 1-digit level for release with the monthly merchandise trade totals. The adjustment is made at that end-use commodity level for which significant stable seasonality is identified. The use of the end-use commodity classification system for seasonal adjustment ensures methodological consistency with the quarterly adjusted balance of trade data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and reflects the BEA coding descriptions which combine data into broad categories based upon principal uses of the commodities.\n                \n              Seller\n                \n                  A principal in the transaction, usually the manufacturer, producer, wholesaler, or distributor of the goods, that receives the monetary benefit or other consideration for the exported goods.\n                \n              Service Center\n                \n                  A company, entity, or organization which has been certified and approved to only transmit complete EEI to the AES. \n                \n              Services\n                \n                  The services statistics are estimates of services transactions between foreign countries and the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories and possessions. Transactions with U.S. military, diplomatic, and consular installations abroad are excluded because they are considered to be part of the U.S. economy. Services are shown in seven broad categories. Types of services for imports and exports are the same for six of the seven categories. They are Travel; Passenger Fares; Other Transportation; Royalties and License Fees; Other Private Services; and U.S. Government Miscellaneous Servcies. For the seventh, exports are \"Transfers Under U.S. Military Sales Contracts\" while for imports the category is \"Direct Defense Expenditures.\" The services statistics are collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n                \n              Shipment\n                \n                  All goods being sent from one USPPI to one consignee located in a single country of destination on a single conveyance and on the same day.  Except as noted in §30.2(a)(1)(iv), the EEI shall be filed when the value of the goods is over $2,500 per Schedule B or HTSA commodity classification code.\n                \n              Shipment Reference Number\n                \n                  A unique identification number assigned to the shipment by the filer for reference purposes.

When such goods, referred to as transiting goods, are shipped under bond, they are not subject to duties and are excluded from the merchandise trade statistics in accordance with the guidelines for international merchandise trade statistics established by the United Nations. Many companies, however, enter transiting goods into the United States using an import entry summary and file an export declaration when the goods leave the United States. While this practice does not affect the total trade balance, it does affect bilateral trade balances, and creates discrepancies between U.S. statistics and those of other countries. This issue is especially problematic for bilateral trade between Canada and the United States, where goods transiting through the United States from Canada are entered as U.S. imports from Canada.

Exemption levels are $2,000 for imports (or $250 for certain quota items), and $2,500 for exports to countries other than Canada. The U.S. Census Bureau has determined that not all required documents are filed, particularly for exports, as import information is subject to greater scrutiny by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in relation to the administration of tariffs, quotas, and other enforcement activities. Goods withdrawn from Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) for exportation, and exports of U.S. goods through Canadian ports en route to other destinations are two examples of commonly unreported shipments that can lead to errors in export statistics. Undocumented foreign merchandise entering FTZs, which should be included in import trade statistics under general imports, is an example of undocumented import data that can contribute to the problem of import under coverage.\n                \n              Unlading\n                \n                  The physical removal of cargo from an aircraft, truck, rail, or vessel.\n                \n              U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) \n                \n                  The border agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) charged with the management, control, and protection of our Nation’s borders at and between the official ports of entry of the United States.\n                \n              U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \n              \n                An agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that is responsible for enforcing customs, immigration and related laws and investigating violations of laws to secure the Nation’s borders.\n                \n              U.S.      Principal Party in Interest (USPPI)\n            \n              The person or legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the export transaction. Generally, that person or entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, or order party, or the foreign entity while in the United States when purchasing or obtaining the goods for export.\n              \n            U.S. State of      Origin\n          \n            The U.S. state of origin is the 2-character postal code for the state in which the goods begin their journey to the port of export.  For example, a shipment covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show Georgia as the state of origin.  The U.S. state of origin may be different from the U.S. state where the goods were produced, mined, or grown.  For shipments of multi-state origin, reported as a single shipment, report the U.S. state of the commodity with the greatest value.  If such information is not known, report the state in which the commodities are consolidated for export. \n            \n          USA Trade Online\n        \n          USA Trade Online is a service provided by the Foreign Trade Division of the U.S. Census Bureau.
